            <h2>WHY MAKE DIY VIDEOS</h2>
            <h2>SHARING YOUR TUTORIALS</h2>
            <h2>TIPS FOR SUCCESS</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="desc_part">
            <h1 id="top_head">Why DIY videos are so effective</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN FROM THE BEST</h3>
                <p>Customers prefer to buy from people they know, like, and trust. A professional video that displays
                    your expertise will give audiences a way to identify you as an authority. Then when viewers need
                    help from a professional in your field, they'll think of your video—and you—first.</p>
                <h3>TUTORIALS EXPLAIN VISUALLY</h3>
                <p>Breaking down a process with video makes it easy for your audience to understand exactly what to do
                    and how. A DIY video takes your audience through each step in a process, so they won't get confused
                    or lost, the way they might with just text or static images.</p>
                <h3>VIDEOS BUILD YOUR PROFILE ON SOCIAL</h3>
                <p>Posting content that's valuable to your audience is part of growing a brand on social. The more you
                    provide video tutorials that helps your audience solve problems or give fresh education, the more
                    they'll like, comment, or share.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="desc_part">
            <h1 id="top_head">Where to share your tutorial videos</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>POST TO SOCIAL MEDIA</h3>
                <p>Animoto lets you publish videos to any of the top social media platforms. Share your tutorial video
                    on a Facebook page, post it as an Instagram Story, or turn it into a YouTube video in minutes.</p>
                <h3>SHARE ON YOUR WEBSITE</h3>
                <p>Whether it's a step-by-step blog post or a sales video for a landing page, posting video content to
                    your website can keep visitors on your site for longer periods of time. Turn your site into a go-to
                    resource for your specialty.</p>
                <h3>USE IN EMAIL MARKETING</h3>
                <p>Increase open rates and engage your list with valuable tutorial videos. Create content that gets your
                    email list excited each time a new email arrives.</p>

            <h1 id="top_head">How to make top-notch tutorials</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>KEEP TEXT VISIBLE</h3>
                <p>If people can't see your words on screen, they won't get the most value out of your content. Make
                    sure to choose text colors that will stand out against your background and select a size that'll be
                    visible even if your audience is watching on mobile.</p>
                <h3>PICK THE RIGHT ASPECT RATIO</h3>
                <p>Animoto lets you choose between landscape and portrait aspect ratios so that you can select the best
                    option for your posting platform. Horizontal video is still the best choice for your website or
                    YouTube, whereas Instagram and Facebook tutorials will look better, and take up more screen space,
                    when they're square.</p>
                <h3>ADD BACKGROUND MUSIC</h3>
                <p>Breathe life into your tutorials by adding an entertaining background soundtrack. Animoto offers
                    thousands of commercially licensed songs to choose from, or you can upload a licensed song of your
                    own.</p>

                 <p>   The site started with Animoto’s Step-based Tutorial storyboard, and in a few minutes they were able to drag and drop photos and video clips they already had right into their project. After adding some text, Peanut Blossom shared their video tutorial on Facebook and their website. The DIY video was a hit, amassing 1.4 million views and adding 5,500 followers to Peanut Blossom’s Facebook page.</p><br>

                <h3> WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF VIDEO TUTORIALS?</h3>
                <p>
                   
The benefits of video tutorials are plentiful. In fact, users are 3X more likely to prefer a tutorial video to written instructions. They combine multiple forms of media like video clips, screen recordings, voice-over messages, and text to guide viewers on how to use a product/service or complete a task. They can also be saved, shared, and rewatched at any time.

            <div>
                <h3> WHY ARE VIDEOS GOOD FOR LEARNING?</h3>
                <p>
                   
Many consumers said that they would prefer to watch a short video about a product or service over any other format. By offering a richer visual and auditory learning experience, video tutorials appeal to a wider audience and are more memorable. Plus, they can be paused, slowed down, and rewatched. You can use Animoto's video tutorial maker to start making informative tutorials for free.

            <div>
                <h3>HOW LONG SHOULD A TUTORIAL VIDEO BE?</h3>
                <p>
                    
Video tutorials should ideally be 3-6 minutes long, but less than 20 minutes at the maximum. Depending on the content of your tutorial, you may want to include helpful links or resources to help reinforce the learnings. With Animoto, you can easily make your tutorial videos as long or as short as you'd like.
