                <p>Social media management tool Buffer has to stay on top of all the latest social trends to succeed. That’s why they decided to run a series of A/B tests to discover exactly what helps a video do well on Facebook. They turned to Animoto, since they wanted to be able to create multiple videos quickly to get results as fast as possible</p><br>
                <p>After more than 60 tests related to aspect ratio, device targeting, and style of content, Buffer learned a lot about social users, including the fact that square videos significantly outperform horizontal ones, especially on mobile. In fact, their square Animoto video gave them their second highest performing video ever, boosting engagement and views and letting Buffer rapidly develop best practices they could share with customers.</p>

                <p>
                    Video length, audio usage, and aspect ratio requirements differ between social media platforms -- it can be difficult to keep them all straight!

                <p>
                    Social channels are prioritizing video content over all others, and for good reason. Promo videos not only boost conversions and sales by as much as 80%, they can build trust, drive engagement, and increase brand recall, and are more likely to be shared than static images.

                <p>

                    Video tutorials should ideally be 3-6 minutes long, but less than 20 minutes at the maximum.
                    Depending on the content of your tutorial, you may want to include helpful links or resources to
                    help reinforce the learnings. With Animoto, you can easily make your tutorial videos as long or as
                    short as you'd like.
