                <h3>VIDEO ADS</h3>
                <p>There are a number of ways to connect with your audience, but video ads might be the most effective when it comes to finding new leads. Post a video that introduces your brand and get customers into your funnel fast.</p>
                <h3>EMAIL MARKETING VIDEOS</h3>
                <p>Engage your email list with informational explainer videos or company announcements. Include info about new products or provide helpful tricks and tips to add value for your audience.</p>
                <h3>PROMOS FOR YOUR WEBSITE</h3>
                <p>Create videos for your website that introduce new visitors to your brand. Incorporate photos or video clips of your team or direct people to where they can find what they need on your site.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>TIMING</h3>
                <p>Edit your promo videos with a time limit in mind. Make sure each promo isn't too long for your intended audience and platform. For example, a video ad on Instagram should usually be much shorter than a normal YouTube video.</p>
                <h3>ASPECT RATIO</h3>
                <p>Make your video the appropriate size for its platform. Facebook and Instagram videos perform better in a square format, Stories look best when they're vertical, and YouTube videos are designed for a horizontal view.</p>
                <h3>CALLS TO ACTION</h3>
                <p>Every promo video should have a unique call to action. In other words, tell viewers what you'd like them to do after watching your video, whether it's subscribing to your email list, downloading your free guide, or simply liking your Facebook page.</p>

                <h3>DETERMINE YOUR OBJECTIVE</h3>
                <p>What is the purpose of your promo video? A sales promo will be far different from a brand introduction. Figure out what you want to accomplish before you start, so you can select the right storyboard template from the very beginning.</p>
                <h3>WRITE A SCRIPT</h3>
                <p>Have an outline written down with a few images or video clips you'd like to include in your video. Then jot down the text for your video as well. This will help you stay on track and speed up your editing process.</p>
                <h3>PREVIEW BEFORE PUBLISHING</h3>
                <p>It's a good idea to review your whole promo video before you publish, which you can easily do right in Animoto. A quick preview lets you make sure you don't see any errors, and you like the way the finished video looks.</p>

                <!-- <h1>Stock images and music at your fingertips</h1> -->
                <p>New York City bakery Cupcake Market wanted to increase their visibility on Facebook and Instagram, and thought video might be the way to go. They quickly created a dynamic promo video in Animoto, showing how they made one of their most popular items—customized cookies decorated to look like real people’s faces.</p><br>
                <p> Their video promo caught on and got the attention of several major news outlets. The publicity helped Cupcake Market get 3x their typical number of website inquiries and a 175% increase in their average order value, growing awareness of the bakery far beyond what they’d imagined possible.</p>

                <p>

                    Video tutorials should ideally be 3-6 minutes long, but less than 20 minutes at the maximum.
                    Depending on the content of your tutorial, you may want to include helpful links or resources to
                    help reinforce the learnings. With Animoto, you can easily make your tutorial videos as long or as
                    short as you'd like.
